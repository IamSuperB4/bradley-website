            <p>
              One of the most popular topics in astronomy is the hunt for exoplanets and potential life on other planets.
              NASA currently has over 5,000 documented exoplanets and counting. A small percentage of those planets are in
              their star’s habitable zone, and an even smaller percentage of those are suitable for life. The
              TRAPPIST and several Kepler solar systems have been widely touted to have the potential for life. My project
              partner, Ani, and I wanted to design a system that could use the information NASA’s exoplanet database
              provides us to help us find which planets fit the criteria for life.

            <p>
              The first step to determine if a planet is habitable is to figure out if a planet is in its star’s habitable 
              zone. There are two processes that can be taken to determine if a planet is in the habitable zone. The first 
              way is to simply use a star’s luminosity and put it against the orbital distance of the planet, as described
              by <a href="https://www.planetarybiology.com/calculating_habitable_zone.html">this</a> website. Luckily, both of these 
              features were provided by the NASA database. With this data, I made a formula that produces a number we can 
              use to determine if it is in the habitable range. We had data in the form of the log of solar luminosities 
              (L☉) and astronomical units (AU, the distance the earth is from the sun):</p>
            <table class="equation">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  &nbsp;
                </td>
                <td>
                  ___
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td style="padding:0px; font-size:larger">
                  Converted Distance = r / &radic;
                </td>
                <td style="padding:0px;">
                  10<sup>L</sup>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
              There is no consensus as to what exactly is the habitable zone. I wanted to be generous, so I took the 
              widest range I could find, which was 0.9 to 1.37. Essentially, these numbers represent mathematically converting 
              the alien solar system units to our solar system’s units, and then determining the habitable zone. So, the 
              habitable zone is 90% of the earth’s distance to the sun to 137% of our distance. Below, there is a Tableau 
              visualization of this. Orange points represent the planets in this habitable zone.

            <h1 class="section-header">Habitable Zone  - Part 2</h1>
            <p>
              The second way to determine if a planet is in the habitable zone is to determine the surface temperature of 
              the planet. We define habitable as the planet’s surface being able to have liquid water, so habitable is 
              between 0-100°C. The first step in this process ended up being far more difficult than we thought. We used 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_equilibrium_temperature">this</a> Wikipedia page to help us 
              with this. It ended up being a complex equation using the star’s radius, star’s temperature, and the planet's 
              orbital radius (r) to determine the energy flux (F) in that part of space, which can then be converted to 
              effective surface temperature (T). Effective temperature is held in this equation:
            </p>
            <p>
              σ<span style="color: red"><b>T</b></span><sup>4</sup> = F = L/(4πr<sup>2</sup>)
            </p>
            <p>
              We ended up finding several dozen planets in the habitable zone. Here is the chart we created to show which 
              planets are habitable based on the surface tempurature calculation. Generally, the mass of the star vs. the
              planet’s distance from the star has a correlation with whether the planet is in the habitable zone, so we
              created that plot. One caveat to this method is that planets can have an atmosphere, which can trap heat, 
              changing its surface tempurature. It tends to lean towards labeling warmer planets habitable compared to the 
              previous method.

            <h1 class="section-header">Other Factors</h1>
            <p>
              There are other factors to consider when determining if a planet is suitable for life. One is the 
              <b><u>density</u></b> of the planet, which would signify a gas planet or a rocky planet (&gt;2.5 = rocky). The 
              <b><u>radius</u></b> (0.5 to 2.5) and <b><u>mass</u></b> (0.3 to 10) of the planet is important. Too big or small 
              affects the gravity of the planet. The last feature we checked was the <b><u>eccentricity</u></b> (&lt;0.25) of 
              the planet’s orbit. The more elongated an orbit, the more the temperature varies during the orbit, making 
              conditions more hostile for life. I built a Tableau visualization that shows which planets are in the habitable 
              zone (in orange), as well as meets the other habitability conditions. Circles represent meeting the basic criteria 
              for life, and ‘+’ represents missing one attribute.
