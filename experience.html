                The majority of my current professional developer experience come from the Kenworth Trucking Company, a subsidiary of PACCAR. 
                I built them a website to track diagnostic information on trucks being built in their plants, and a custom project tracking 
                tool for the advanced manufacturing engineering division.

            <h1 class="section-header">Kenworth Trucking Co. – Software Developer – Chassis Chaser - Kirkland, WA - August 2019 - December 2022</h1>
            <p>
                During my time at the University of Washington, I worked at Kenworth as a contracted software developer. Being a contractor 
                allowed flexibility in my work hours during school. I worked part-time during school, and full-time during breaks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was tasked to build a website, called Chassis Chaser, that helped Paccar’s plants around the world have up-to-date diagnostic 
                information about all the trucks on the factory line. I was able to provide a wealth of information to diagnosticians, managers, 
                engineers, and data analysts. Some of the key information I tracked was the VIN, electronic control units (ECUs), their software 
                parts and software version, programming tests completed at stations on the line, and the current location of each chassis. Across 
                all 7 plants there are a few hundred trucks built per day. Thanks to Chassis Chaser, diagnosticians went from searching through a 
                bunch of XML log files manually to just searching for a specific chassis on the website to find the information they needed. A 
                15–60-minute process turned into a 10 second process, creating immense time savings for people in the plants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chassis Chaser has 4 key parts: the Angular frontend, a .NET Core API, a SQL database, and a .NET Core service that runs on a server 
                collecting real-time chassis data. All of this was designed and built from scratch. I also have to thank my mentors from Paccar’s IT 
                department for helping me throughout the process: Matt and Isaac.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first part of the process was to collect requirements for exactly what data and features the stakeholders wanted. I had meetings 
                with key diagnosticians, testers, managers, and engineers who would use Chassis Chaser on a daily basis. Everyone wanted a variety 
                of features, some feasible and some not, some critical and some miscellaneous. I continued these meetings until we had a list of 
                requirements with priorities and time estimates.
