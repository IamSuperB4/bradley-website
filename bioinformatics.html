              Bioinformatics is the application of tools of computation and analysis to the capture and interpretation of 
              biological data. We get to use data science techniques to analyze biological data, such as DNA. I took a 
              Bioinformatics course during my last quarter of college (CSS 383). We learned how to read biology research 
              papers, use bioinformatics libraries in Python, and had a quarter-long project to complete. The class 
              combined both computer science and biology majors, so it was very interesting to be able to work 
              side-by-side with biologists. My group ended up having 1 other computer science student and 2 biology students. 
              We helped them with the coding portions and they helped us with the biology research, then we worked together 
              to complete the project.

            <p>
              The title of our research was “<i>Dopamine Evolution Impacts on Social Group Sizes</i>”. The question we were 
              trying to solve was “<i>How does the evolution of dopamine receptor proteins correlate with changes in social 
              group size in mammals?</i>” We thought that since because humans and other mammals release dopamine when we 
              are around others in our species, there would be a correlation between dopamine evolution and social group 
              sizes.

            <h1 class="section-header">Data and Methods</h1>
            <p>
              The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has thousands of genomes sequenced for free use by the community. They 
              have entire DNA sequences and separate out the different genes; dopamine receptors being one of these genes.
            </p>
            <p>To do our research and analysis, we needed pairs of mammals of the same genus and their DNA. With each pair of 
              mammals, we needed to see the evolutionary differences between them. To calculate this difference, there is an 
              equation called the <a href="https://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/calculating-dnds-for-ngs-datasets/">dN/dS ratio</a>. 
              It lets us assign a value to how much each sequence diverges evolutionarily. This dN/dS ratio is determined by 
              finding where the species share dopamine genes, aligning the gene sequences (bases can be lost or gained over 
              evolution, but stay in the same place), calculating the dN/dS ratio for each conon (3 DNA bases/letters), then 
              we create an aggregate score for each pair of genes. This is all done in Python using a combination of our 
              own code and Python libraries for bioinformatics.</p>
            <p>
              Finally, we plotted the social group size difference vs. the dN/dS ratio for each pair of species. If there was 
              a correlation between the two, we would see it in the graph. We also used the ACTN3 as a control, which is a 
              muscle gene.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second part of our work was to research the social group sizes of each species. There is no master list with 
              this information, so we had to scour the internet for research papers with this information.

            <p>
              Unfortunately, our results did not show a statistically significant correlation between the evolution of dopamine 
              receptors and social group size. This is sadly a common occurrence in the world of biology and bioinformatics. 
              Tons of time and money can be spent on research just to get inconclusive results or results against your hypothesis. 
              However, this is part of the scientific process that leads to some great discoveries. Here are the charts with our 
              results:
